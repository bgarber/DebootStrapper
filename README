DebootStrapper - tool to help creating custom installations of Debian.

!!!!!WARNING!!!!!
================================================================================

This script is VERY DANGEROUS. It can (and potentially WILL) cause data loss if
you DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! You can 'play' with it on a virtual machine, but
be at your own risk while trying to use it on a real machine! Keep in mind that
this method of installation is for experienced users.

At this moment, my judgement is that this script is still VERY UNSTABLE. Anyone
is welcome to contribute with ideas and code.

There's a lot of things to do. At the top of mind, I can cite:

- encapsulate inside a function the execution of "chrooted" commands;
- give more liberty to choose the bootloader;
- full automatization of the installation process, via config file.
